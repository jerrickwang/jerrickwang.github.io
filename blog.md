      <p>Went to Alamo Square and got licked by a dog but it was worth the picture, I think. Unfortunately, the Painted Ladies weren't as nice as I thought. Thinking about going to see lower Haight-Ashbury next.</p>

      <p>Fully operational site. Will make small visual improvements over time. With inspiration from my friend at Berkeley, I have created an online portfolio and blog to write about my experiences as a photographer in San Francisco and Berkeley. I'd like to track my own development as a photographer and document it.</p>
