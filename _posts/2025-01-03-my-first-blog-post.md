Due to inspiration from my friend at Berkeley, I have created an online portfolio and blog to write about my experiences as a photographer in San Francisco and Berkeley. I think only 5 people will ever see this website but it's still fun for myself to track my own development as a photographer and document it. Thanks for reading!
