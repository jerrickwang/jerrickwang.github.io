      <p>I purchased a EF 50mm f/1.8 STM from B&H Photo recently and I took it out as soon as the weather allowed. With an older DSLR body, it helps a lot for IQ when there's a lot of light to keep the ISO low. On bright days, there's in fact too much light and my body can't go any faster than 1/4000, which is a great issue to have. It's a lot of fun and I think I'll try out some more street photography, as I never really took off the 75-300 before. The 50mm is staying on my camera for a while.</p>

      <p>Fully operational site. Will make small visual improvements over time. With inspiration from my friend at Berkeley, I have created an online portfolio and write about my experiences as a photographer in San Francisco and Berkeley.</p>
