Hello! I'm Jerrick. This is my photography portfolio site. I have an interest in street, wildlife, and portrait photography. For privacy reasons, I have omitted all portraiture from my portfolio. Please click on "Portfolio" to load all images. <br><br>
I plan to write my experience as a beginner photographer over time in a blog on this site like in the old days of the internet. Stay tuned for that and thanks for coming by!
