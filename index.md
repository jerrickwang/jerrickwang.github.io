Hello! I'm Jerrick, a photographer from San Francisco. I started my photography journey in early 2024. I have an interest in street, wildlife, and portrait photography. For privacy reasons, I have omitted all portraiture from my portfolio. Please click on "Portfolio" to load all images. <br><br>
I plan to write my experience as a beginner photographer over time in a blog on this site. Thanks for coming by!
