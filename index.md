Hello! I'm Jerrick, and this is my personal website for showing off things I like, mainly photography, based out of San Francisco and Berkeley, California. I have an interest in street, wildlife, landscape, and portrait photography. For privacy reasons, I have omitted all portraiture from my portfolio. Please click on "Portfolio" to load all images. (Note: there is some loading time necessary)
